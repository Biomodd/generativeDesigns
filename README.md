some generative explorations for Biomodd[NYC4]

Commit by Pieter Steyaert | subtiv on 21.10.12

 ORGANIC MOVEMENT // simple particle class
 recompiled and abstracted for biomodd [NYC4].
 Example app doesn't have that much functionality:
 hit any key to change the velocity mode.
 Check "SUBTIV_CONSTANTS.h" for more options.

  METABALL CLASS
 recompiled and abstracted for biomodd [NYC4].
 Example app doesn't have that much functionality:
 move mouse to create new metaballs...

TAIL example, abstracted from LOUISe (master project
2012). Modified for Biomodd[NYC4]

 MESHLINE
 recompiled and abstracted for biomodd [NYC4].
 Example app doesn't have that much functionality:
 Move the mouse to "stretch" out the line...

There are also two openGL shaders:
* breathing
=> simple "scaling" shader for breathing simulation purposes
* noiseCol
=> applies a noisy color shader on geometry
